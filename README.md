Tip-Calculator: Project Description

In this project, our aim is to build a modern tip calculator.
Project's primary interface comprises a container labeled "Tip Calculator" with two input fields: 1) For the bill amount. 2) For the tip percentage.
Tip calculator has a modern design which is styled using CSS.
I have utilized JavaScript to obtain the values of the two input fields and calculate the Total Amount based on these values.
